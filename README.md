## How to run 
1. **Install an emulator**
A simple emulator that is easy to use is called genymotion. Simply install it with [this link](https://www.genymotion.com/download/), create a new emulation of any device and start it up.
2. **Run the app**
Once you have your emulator running open up a terminal and go to the project directory and type 'flutter run' to run the app on the emulator. Hit 'r' to refresh the emulator when changes are made.
3. **View the app**
Once the app is running you can view it in the emulator by opening up the emulator and it should open automatically if not go to the 'apps' tab. You should see the app in the list.
